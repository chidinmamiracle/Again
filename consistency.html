      You can repeat this process for any number of branches, making it a great
      method to keep track of multiple remotes. Remember, though, that this is
      only a local setup, so if you push this branch to your primary repository,
      others wonâ€™t have their copies of the deployment branch configured to use
      the second remote automatically.
